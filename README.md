# OR_Utilization-Group-5
A machine learning system that predicts actual surgery durations to improve operating room scheduling and utilization.
# OR Utilization Analysis & Predictive Scheduling Model

This repository contains the complete analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning workflow used to predict actual surgical case durations and improve Operating Room (OR) utilization. The core implementation is inside the Jupyter Notebook:

### 📄 `notebooks/OR_Utilisation_Analysis.ipynb`

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- A/B statistical comparison between booked and actual durations
- Feature engineering and pipeline creation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- RandomForest & XGBoost regression models
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²
- Visualizations (Actual vs Predicted, Residuals, Error distribution)
- Saving the final model using Joblib
